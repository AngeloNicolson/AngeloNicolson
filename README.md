Hi, my name is Angelo!
I am a elf taught graphics programming enthusiast. (Eating up as much knowledge as I can), 
I am also a college student currently studying software development at developers institute.

One day i want to open a tech company producing engaging and interactive games (Verticle slice in progress).
Would like to change the New Zealand games industry and Keep Developers here, instead of loosing them overseas.
Business model will focus on users which with a foundation in morally correct business practices (Not predatory practices taking advantage of users and fans), Building a community of fans and coworkers, centered around existing open source software and providing open source content.  Always community and fun, Never greed

Humanity Can grow exponentially though knowledge and resource sharing.
