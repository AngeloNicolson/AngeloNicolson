- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Angelo!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development, graphics, UI, Web development and learning to code!
- Self taught graphics programming enthusiast. (Eating up as much knowledge as I can), 
I am also a driven college student currently studying software development at developers institute.
I have experience in team leadership and tight schedules. Can work well individually or in a group setting. Proficient in 3D applications . Demonstrated aptitude to learn quickly on the job.

I will one day open a tech company producing engaging and interactive games (Verticle slice in progress).
Would like to change the New Zealand games industry and Keep Developers here, instead of loosing them overseas.
Business model will focus on users which with a foundation in morally correct business practices (Not predatory practices taking advantage of users and fans), Building a community of fans and coworkers, centered around existing open source software and providing open source content.  Always community and fun, Never greed

Humanity Can grow exponentially though knowledge and resource sharing.
