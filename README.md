Hi, my name is Angelo!

I love being challenged and push past my previously conceived limits.
Diving into code and trying to understanding how or why coding languages work the way they do excites me.
I am a self taught graphics programming enthusiast. (Eating up as much knowledge as I can), 
I am also a college student about to start bachelor of science, Computer science.

One day I want to open a tech company producing engaging and interactive games and recources.
My ambition is to also create educational interactive web applications for kids that will inspire the next generation in a positive way.
My business model will focus on users with a foundation in morally correct business practices (Not predatory practices taking advantage of users and fans), 
Building a community of fans and coworkers, centered around existing open source software and providing our tech as open source.  Always community and fun, Never greed

Humanity Can grow exponentially though knowledge and resource sharing.
